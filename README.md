# ðŸ‘€ Overview

Week 1 prompt's was to take a design from Dribble and recreate it with code. I chose a simple travel blog design from [Markez Bell](https://dribbble.com/shots/14017377-Nomadic-Homepage). I decide to create this using Vue because that's what I am currently trying to learn and thought this would be great practice for working with components. Overall, I enjoyed taking a design mockup and transfering it into code. I had to visualize mobile and tablet sizes since the mockup was on a large screen size.
